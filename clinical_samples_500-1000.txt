['But he went one step further than his predecessors and analyzed how the emitted rays formed optical images Rucker ',
'He perceived he could obtain an optical image of the eye fundus by devising an instrument that would allow his own eye to be placed in line with the light rays entering and leaving the eye ',
'He used three plates of glass which acted as a mirror to reflect light but were still transparent enough to see through ',
'The first ophthalmoscope was composed of microscopic cover glasses and pieces of cardboard glued together ',
'At the age of he became the first individual to see the retina in all its anatomic details Years later he said that had he not been theoretically convinced that it must succeed he would not have persevered Rucker ',
'The announcement was made in a paper presented by his friend Du Bois Reymond another student of Mueller to the Berlin Physical Society on December ',
'This paper was not published and was lost ',
'However on December Helmholtz wrote a letter to his father as follows ',
'I have made a discovery during my lectures on the Physiology of the Sense organs which may be of the utmost importance in ophthalmology It was so obvious requiring moreover no knowledge beyond the optics I learned at the Gymnasium that it seems almost ludicrous that I and others should have been so slow as not to see it ',
'It is namely a combination of glasses by means of which it is possible to see the dark background of the eye through the pupil without employing any dazzling light and to obtain a view of all the elements of the retina at once more exactly than one can see the external parts of the eye without magnification because the transparent media of the eye act like a lens with magnifying power of twenty ',
'The blood vessels are displayed in the neatest way with the branching arteries and veins the entrance of the optic nerve into the eye &c ',
'Till now a whole series of most important eye diseases known collectively as black cataract have been terra incognita because the changes in the eye were practically unknown both during life and generally speaking after death ',
'My discovery makes the minute investigation of the internal structures of the eye a possibility ',
'I have announced this very precious egg of Columbus to the Physical Society at Berlin as my property and am now having an improved and more convenient instrument constructed to replace my pasteboard affair ',
'I shall examine as many patients as possible with the chief oculist here and then publish the matter ',
'Rucker ',
'pp ',
'Helmholtz called his new instrument Augenspiegel ',
'This was the name of an instrument in use in Germany for some time that consisted of a lens and a mirror for reflecting the light ',
'The instrument was used for examining the coats and adnexa of the eye ',
'This instrument was known in England as an eye speculum in Holland as oogspiegel and in France as ophthalmoscope ',
"The word ophthalmoscope was used to describe Helmholtz's instrument in the medical literature for the first time in by Maressal de Marsilly of Calais France Rucker ",
'The indirect method of ophthalmoscopy was invented by Ruete in ',
'Practicing physicians did not appreciate the benefit of he ophthalmoscope to any degree ',
'Clifford Allbutt wrote in The number of physicians who are working with the ophthalmoscope today in England may I believe be counted on the fingers of one hand ',
'Allbutt did much to change this with his book On the Use of the Ophthalmoscope in Diseases of the Nervous System and the Kidneys published in ',
'Thermoscopes which indicate a change in temperature have existed in one form or another since antiquity ',
'Thermometers which measure the change on a scale are a relatively recent development ',
'For many years it was believed that body temperatures vary depending upon the climate ',
'The first problem posed in De Logistica Medica a European book on medical mathematics in was To find the natural degree of temperature of each man as determined by his age the time of year the elevation of the pole that is the latitude and other influences Boorstin ',
'Galileo invented a device that he called a scherzino a little joke which used alcohol to measure changes in the temperature of the air Major ',
'Sanctorius a colleague of Galileo at the University of Padua is given credit for introducing the thermoscope into medicine although his work had little or no influence at the time ',
"The goal of Sanctorius following the dictates of Hippocrates was to determine if there was a change in the patient's temperature thereby giving prognostic information ",
"He modified Galileo's thermoscope for use with a patient 'The patient grasps the bulb or breathes upon it into a hood or takes the bulb into his mouth so that we can tell if the patient be better or worse so as not to be led astray in knowledge of prognosis or cure ",
'Considerable progress was made in Florence in developing instruments for measuring temperature ',
'At the Academia del Cimento founded in thermoscopes were sealed off from the atmospheric pressure perhaps justifying for the first time the word thermometer ',
'There was no universally agreed upon scale for the measurement however and no consensus regarding a substance to use while the Florentines used alcohol Isaac Newton used linseed oil ',
'Boerhaave is said to have suggested to Fahrenheit that mercury would be suitable for the fluid ',
'Fahrenheit experimented with various scales before settling upon ice and boiling water as the two fixed points by he had determined that axillary temperature is degrees Keele ',
'Boerhaave used it as a research instrument on his beds at Leyden ',
"Anton de Haen one of Boerhaave's pupils who became a leader of the Old Vienna School introduced thermometry into the practice and teaching of medicine according to Wunderlich ",
'De Haen left the thermometer in for minutes and then added or degrees Fahrenheit to the registered temperature ',
'He was aware of the morning remission and evening exacerbation of temperatures of the rise of temperature during the febrile rigor of the persistence of fever temperatures after intermittent fevers have apparently been cured and of the discrepancies between pulse and temperature in some patients and in certain diseases Wunderlich ',
"However de Haen's work with temperature was neglected after his death ",
'Celsius in divided the scale into degrees taking zero as the boiling point of water and as the melting point of ice this was inverted by Christin a year later ',
'Clinical thermometers were well known by the s ',
'By John Hunter was writing to Jenner that the temperature under the human tongue was degrees in all countries ',
'Ludwig Traube in Berlin in suggested to Wunderlich a systematic study of temperatures in human beings ',
'Carl August Wunderlich was professor of medicine at Leipzig ',
'In he published Medical Thermometry and Human Temperature in which he had assembled information on patients ',
'The classic temperature patterns of many diseases such as typhoid were depicted ',
'From the preface ',
'For the last sixteen years my attention has been uninterruptedly directed to the course pursued by the temperature in diseases of various kinds ',
'I have gradually brought together a mass of notes which comprises many thousand complete cases of thermometric observations of diseases and millions of separate readings of the temperature ',
'The more my observations multiplied the more firm my conviction was of the value of this method of investigation ',
'And though theoretical questions as to human temperature and kindred subjects must not be overlooked my purpose has been to prepare from these notes a practical book ',
'A knowledge of the course of temperature in disease is indispensable to medical practitioners ',
'Because all the phenomena of the sick are deserving of study ',
'The temperature may be determined with a nicety which is common to few other phenomena ',
'The temperature can neither be feigned nor falsified ',
'We may conclude the presence of some disturbance in the economy from the mere fact of altered temperature ',
"Wunderlich's book established the fundamental importance of the measurement of temperature in clinical medicine ",
"Clinicians had described a number of neurologic reflexes before the pupillary light reflex absence of a blink reflex in Bell's palsy the grasp reflex flexion of a spastic leg upon stroking the sole ",
'These were generally accounted to be protective in nature ',
'In William Erb reported for the first time on the elicitation and significance of the deep tendon reflexes using a reflex hammer ',
'Slightly flexed at the hip and knee the leg is held fast while all its muscles are relaxed and with a finger or percussion hammer a very light and elastic tap is delivered exactly as in very light and elastic percussion of the chest or in testing for fluid in the abdomen to the region of the ligamentum patellae ',
'Each tap is followed by a contraction of the quadriceps immediate like lightning unmistakable visible palpable and apparently reflex manifestly and often quite strongly is the shank set in motion ',
'It is extraordinarily difficult to suppress this reflex by a voluntary effort ',
'Schiller p ',
'Erb had been testing this reflex for some years finding it of diagnostic significance in diseases of the spinal cord much more exquisitely brisk in many patients with diseases of the spinal cord ',
'Ankle clonus had been described previously by Charcot in spinal cord disease but Erb made it clear that his reflex was different ',
'His paper was titled On the Tendon Reflexes in Health and in Diseases of the Spinal Cord ',
'In the same issue of the Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten there appeared another paper dealing with the same reflex written by the editor of the journal Carl Westphal ',
'Westphal had an explanatory footnote at the bottom of the first page ',
'He had been astonished to receive a paper from Erb dealing with the same facts that he himself was about to publish ',
'He too had been testing the reflex for several years and his observations agreed with those of Erb ',
"He had gotten Erb's permission for the two papers to appear side by side ",
'Erb and Westphal had hit upon the unique spot in the body where scientific purity and simplicity reign because only two neurons are involved in the reflex ',
'They had struck a source of untapped knowledgeknowledge that previous generations of physiologists would have found useless ',
'The source turned into a sea of names and claims a flood of reflexes ',
'Schiller p ',
'The hammer used to elicit the reflex had been developed for percussing the chest ',
'The idea for the percussion hammer apparently came from Gerhard van Swieten of the Old Vienna School ',
'Van Swieten in turn credited the idea to a Swiss physician of the preceding century Johann Jacob Wepfer ',
"Wepfer got the idea from cowherds men who diagnosed echinococcal and cysticercoid cysts of the brain by systematically hitting the animal's head with a mallet and trephining any area that resonated Schiller ",
'The story thus comes full circle an instrument initially used for neurological diagnosis in cows and sheep was used in chest diseases in humans and then again in neurology ',
'Gowers termed the reflex the knee jerk in and for decades it was the only reflex that was tested routinely ',
"In Gowers's text of he listed the ankle jerk but made no mention of its absence in sciatica ",
'The jaw jerk was described by Beevor in ',
'Just as the numbers of reflexes grew exponentially so did the instruments used for eliciting the tendon jerks as well as percussing the chest ',
'Gowers used his stethoscope to elicit them ',
'J ',
'Madison Taylor had invented the triangular hammer so widely used today by ',
'In the mecca of neurology Queen Square in London around a Miss Wintle hit upon the happy device of fitting a ring pessary to a solid brass wheel and mounting this upon a stick of bamboo ',
'The result was a heavy springy and completely painless hammer ',
'Critchley quoted in Schiller ',
'The first measurement of blood pressure was by the Reverend Stephen Hales in about ',
'Hales was a clergyman educated at Cambridge with an enduring interest in science ',
'He is considered the founder of plant physiology as well as the father of hemodynamics ',
"His measurement of the blood pressure was the first major advance in circulatory physiology since Harvey's demonstration of the circulation of blood ",
'Hales was led to his experiments by his interest in the forces that lead to muscular contraction ',
'The wisdom of the time was that the force of the blood during systole caused a dilation of the vessels which caused the contraction ',
'After he read the unsatisfactory Conjectures of several writers about the Cause of muscular Motion it occurred to me that by fixing Tubes to the Arteries of live Animals I might find pretty nearly whether the Blood by its meer hydraulick Energy could have a sufficient Force by dilating the Fibres of the acting Muscles and thereby shortening their Lengths to produce the great Effects of muscular Motion quoted in Cohen p ',
'He tied a horse on its back and laid open the crural artery and then ',
'I inserted into it the artery a brass pipe whose bore was lth inch in diameter and to that by means of another brass pipe which was fitly adapted to it I fixed a glass tube of nearly the same diameter which was ft ',
'in length ',
'Then tying the ligature on the artery the blood rose in the tube ft ',
' inches perpendicular above the level of the left ventricle of the heart ',
'Quoted in Keele p ',
'The jugular pressure he found to be inches when the horse was quiet and inches when it struggled ',
'He estimated human blood pressure to be ',
'feet which is fairly close ',
'Hales also calculated the mean velocity of the blood in the aorta the velocity of the systolic output and the diastolic pressure ',
'Hales gratified his scientific passion while serving as the rector of the Church of St ',
"Mary's in the Meadows at Teddington ",
'His close friends including the poet Alexander Pope observed that Hales looked upon wicked individuals without indignation not from want of discernment or sensibility but he used to consider them only as those experiments which upon trial he found could never be applied to any useful purpose and which he therefore calmly and dispassionately laid aside ',
"One surmises that scientific detachment pervaded the entirety of Reverend Hales's life ",
'Johannes Mueller see above remarked that the discovery of blood pressure was even more important than discovery of the circulation of the blood ',
"One hundred years later Poiseuille substituted a mercury manometer for Hales's glass tube Keele ",
'Potassium carbonate was used as an anticoagulant ',
'Ludwig added a float recorder and kymograph in thus making possible physiological experiments involving the blood pressure ',
'Measuring arterial pressure directly was obviously unsuitable clinically ',
'Vierordt in attempted to measure blood pressure by determining the weight necessary to obliterate the radial pulse Keele ',
'Ritter von Basch used a water filled rubber bulb attached to a manometer and later an aneroid barometer ',
'Potain used air in the arm band and attached the aneroid barometer ',
'In Riva Rocci published the method in use today of employing a rubber air filled bladder and a mercury manometer ',
'The Greeks were aware of the necessity of a clinical history as illustrated by the quotation from Hippocrates at the beginning of this chapter ',
'Rufus or Ruphos of Ephesus wrote what is apparently the first formal document solely about the history On the Interrogation of the Patient ',
'Very little is known about Rufus ',
'He lived around a d ',
'Galen spoke admiringly of him ',
'He is thought to have studied and practiced in Rome although this is not certain ',
'He wrote a number of other books that were esteemed by his contemporaries and later Arabian physicians On the Names of Various Parts of the Body Treatise on the Pulse Treatise on Diseases of the Kidneys find of the Bladder ',
'His statements about the history are really remarkable ',
'It is important to ask questions of patients because with the help of these questions one will know more exactly some of the things that concern the disease and one will neat the disease better ',
'One should start by interrogating the patient himself ',
'One will learn just how sane or troubled the patient is and the degree of strength or weakness of the patient ',
'One will obtain a certain notion of the disease process and of the body site affected ',
'One can conclude that the spirit and mind are in good shape if the patient responds in a suitable manner with a faithful memory ',
'It is a sign of delirium if you ask one question of the patient and he replies with another or forgets what he is saying when he talks ',
'The physician will interrogate the patient first and then question the relatives and friends especially if he cannot learn from the patient himself ',
'It is important at the beginning to find out precisely when the disease process began ',
'You will ask about the rapidity and manifestations of the diseasewhether the damaging phenomena develop rapidly or on the contrary arrive and progress slowly ',
'Ask if the disease has been present in the same patient previously ',
'I believe it is important to be informed of the nature of the disease in each individual patient because we are not all formed in the same fashion but we differ markedly from one another in many respects ',
'Quoted in R ',
"D'Ephèse ",
'Rufus cites a contemporary who feels it is completely unnecessary for the physician to question the patient ',
'Rufus feels this is in error The physician will be instructed and wiser about the patient if he interrogates the patient ',
'Rufus writes at length about what to him are important aspects of the history nourishment habits season of the year when the disease began sleep habits content of dreams medications and regimens the patient has been subjected to a full characterization of the location and nature of pains types of food eaten and location of water drunk by the patient ',
'In short Rufus demonstrates an approach to history taking that is truly extraordinary for his time ',
'The modern view of the history probably began with the French School of Corvisart Laennec Louis and Andral Keele ',
'They are responsible as nearly as can be told for what might be termed the modern clinical method ',
'Boerhaave exemplified the best up until the time of the French as noted previously he made rounds with his students on beds each day questioning and inspecting the patient examining the urine and feces and going to the autopsy table if the patient died ',
'The next great step was that of the French School exemplified by Martinet ',
'Louis Martinet in published A Manual of Pathology containing the symptoms diagnosis and Morbid Characters of Diseases together with an exposition of the different Methods of Examination applicable to the affections of the Head Chest and Abdomen ',
'In his preface Martinet states that he intends his book as a clinical guide containing a brief statement of the necessary requisites for the proper conduct of clinical pursuits ',
"Martinet's clinical examination scheme fills seventy four pages of this small book ",
'Martinet begins his book with an Exposition of the Various Methods of Examination Used in Medicine ',
'Selected quotations ',
'It is at the bedside of the patient that the observer must study disease there he will see it in its true character stripped of those false shades by which it is so frequently disguised in books ',
'The physician should be calm and conciliating should hear with attention the communications which his patients make should put his questions to them with mildness listen kindly to their complaints and never fail to demonstrate an active interest in their welfare ',
'In drawing up a case it should always be recollected that it is done with the view to convey to others an exact representation of the facts which we have observed ',
'The report of a case should be like the copy of a picture ',
'The leading symptoms particularly those which serve to establish the diagnosis should first be noted down ranged according to their importance reference always being made as far as can be done to the order of their appearance ',
'It may however be sometimes useful to note the absence of any particular symptoms which usually exist in similar cases lest the omission may be attributed to negligence or forgetfulness on the part of the observer and so discredit be cast on the facts he has detailed ',
'The observations should be transcribed immediately after the visit in a book kept for the purpose as being the only means of ensuring correctness in the statements ',
'When commencing to take down a case first note the name sex age and occupation of the patient this should be done according to the form above given ',
'In some cases it becomes necessary to state the country or district from which the patient conies and the diseases which prevail there ',
'The acute and chronic forms of disease require a plan of examination and narration altogether different ',
'Everything connected with the previous history should be known and stated fully in chronic cases it is the only means of throwing any light on the obscurity which so generally surrounds them ',
'But in acute cases this is far less necessary ',
"Martinet from Quain's translation ",
"Martinet's history begins with taking the full history as applicable to all diseases he then uses special methods for the three great cavities of the bodythe brain chest and abdomen Keele ",
'After the history comes the physical examination ',
'The stethoscope is used before percussion on the chest ',
'Inspection percussion palpation and auscultation are used systematically for the chest head and abdomen ',
'Rectal examination is performed to detect prostatic enlargement ',
'The skin muscles nerves mucous and synovial membranes lymphatics and veins are noted specifically ',
"Martinet's remarks could fit with ease into a modern physical diagnosis book ",
'His scheme illustrates the clinical method as developed by the great clinicians of the French School ',
"An interesting contrast to Martinet's methods are those of Peter Latham at St ",
"Bartholomew's Hospital ",
'He writes in The patient being placed before me I ask him no question until I have learned everything worthy of remark which my own eyes can inform me of ',
'from Keele p ',
'Comments in the literature about history taking are quite sparse for the next century ',
'G ',
'L ',
'Engel has this to say about the meagerness of the historical record ',
'I am not particularly bothered that the record is as sparse as it is ',
'Eliciting historical accounts of the experiences of others as a means of gaining knowledge is of course as old as man ',
'It is also quintessentially human and is after all one of the ways we learn from early childhood on that is from the stories that others have to tell about that which is not known or is unfamiliar to us ',
'It is for this reason I suspect that the process of history taking has not until very recently been thought of as anything that needed to be taught or even studied much less as a scientific method ',
"Yet if science and being scientific represent man's most persistent effort to extend and organize knowledge by reasoned efforts that ultimately depend on evidence that can be consensually validated as Charles Odegaard has said then history taking or interviewing does qualify as a scientific method ",
'Even Rufus of Ephesus appeared to know that intuitively ',
'Thus he recommends asking questions in order that physicians know more exactly some of the things that concern the disease a suitable manner of patient response is with a faithful memory he recommends verification by questioning relatives and friends advises that the physician find out precisely ',
'Therein is captured the essence of science in the human realm of history taking a perspective disregarded in this era dominated by the biomedical model ',
'Engel personal communication ',
'Stoeckle and Billings have surveyed the history of the medical interview in the United States since the beginning of the twentieth century ',
'Inferences about the history can be obtained from hospital records ',
"Examples from Richard Cabot's Case Teaching in Medicine illustrate detailed histories with one or two lines regarding the patient's social circumstances Stoeckle and Billings ",
'From to the s in the United States as well as elsewhere there were no instructional texts on history taking ',
'Teaching was by senior physicians acting as role models at the bedside ',
'With rare exceptions there were no verbatim accounts of the history and students themselves were rarely if ever actually observed or critiqued doing a history ',
'Didactic material on what to ask was found albeit sparsely in physical diagnosis texts and manuals on the physical examination ',
'Questions given as examples were highly specific Have you ever had tuberculosis ',
'There was circumscribed attention to social circumstances ',
'After Martinet the next real advance in history taking came with the publication of The Clinical Interview by Felix Deutsch and William Murphy in ',
'The book was based in part upon reviewing transcribed tapes of psychiatric resident interviews of patients over a period of years ',
'The process of the interview received detailed attention ',
'If the examiner allows the patient to talk without asking leading questions or answering his questions the patient will usually give a detailed account of his complaints and ideas about his illness ',
'Having exhausted his ideas and recollections regarding his organic disturbances he will stop and wait to be asked a question ',
"The examiner waits until he feels that the patient will not continue spontaneously and he then repeats one of the points in the patient's last sentence in an interrogative form ",
'Usually the therapist repeats one of the somatic complaints last mentioned being careful to use the same wording as the patient ',
'The patient then as a rule gives new information centering around his symptoms and is stimulated to further associations ',
'P ',
'Deutsch and Murphy termed this method associative anamnesis or associative exploration ',
'Medical students began to be taught this method notably beginning with the course in Clinical Methods designed and used at the University of Rochester by Morgan and Engel ',
'Their text introduced the method to other medical schools see Morgan and Engel ',
'The Rochester course and text represent a landmark in history taking and in the approach to the patient ',
'The book is the first text on clinical skills that approaches the history and interviewing differently from what had been so long a tradition of neglect ',
'The biopsychosocial concept as articulated by Engel has now become the standard approach to the history ',
'The spread and refinement of the history and physical examination in the United States followed the development of medical education ',
'This development has been the subject of a recent book by Ludmerer ',
'The outline below follows his excellent account ',
'The Civil War pointed up with brutal clarity the deficiencies of American physicians ',
'One estimate is that Union soldiers died from wounds and from disease Confederate soldiers died from wounds and from disease ',
'Percussion was performed by only a small portion of physicians ',
'Very few used the thermometer ',
'Stethoscopes were rarely used ',
'Large doses of laxatives and emetics were given for therapy ',
'The U S ',
'government finally required that each physician entering the army or navy pass a compulsory examination barely passed ',
'The U S ',
'physician of this time was a product of the medical education system of several dozen proprietary and a few university schools ',
'Admission requirements consisted of one question Can the applicant pay the fees ',
'Instruction was almost totally didactic anatomy was taught without benefit of dissection ',
'The faculty of a typical proprietary school was composed of six to eight professors ',
'The pervasive spirit was commercialism with the teachers sharing the spoils of what was left of student tuition after expenses were paid ',
'There were some bright spots ',
'Alternatives and supplements available included apprenticeship being a house pupil in a hospital additional work during the summer by extramural non degree granting schools and by going to Europeespecially Franceas has been described above ',
'There was a profound skepticism toward medical science and experimentation among American physicians from until the last half of the century ',
'This reflected the influence of the French School ',
'The laboratory sciences were distrusted ',
'In American physicians who had studied in France founded the Society for Medical Observation ',
'By way of contrast American physicians influenced by study in Germany founded in the American Society for Clinical Investigation ',
'This attitude against research profoundly influenced medical education until beyond the Civil War ',
"It is illustrated by the fact that at no medical school in the s did research constitute a part of a faculty member's responsibilities Ludmerer ",
"The faculty lectured and administrated on the school's time and saw private patients on their own time ",
'An extraordinary change occurred between and American physicians journeyed to Germany for their postgraduate education ',
'As noted earlier went between and ',
'The physicians who went to Germany had to have significant means a spartan living cost $ a year ',
'Consequently they were young male from the East Coast and the upper strata of society Ludmerer ',
'They took one of two paths ',
'They gained practical experience in the newly developing specialties of ophthalmology dermatology laryngology obstetrics and surgery and then came home to go into private practice ',
'This groupestimated to be some of the number cited abovemostly went to Vienna where the New Vienna School provided exceptional clinical opportunities ',
'A smaller group went to study the fundamental medical sciences ',
'These people came back to America and became the leaders in American medicine until well in the s William Welch Franklin Mall Henry Bowditch etc ',
'When these individuals returned they were frustrated beyond measure because America simply had nothing comparable to the German university ',
'A development that fortunately paralleled the return from Germany of these individuals was the emergence of the American university between and ',
'After the Civil War the old fashioned college evolved into the modern university ',
'At the root of this transformation was the astounding growth of information that occurred in all scholarly fields Ludmerer ',
'Professional schools including medicine moved into the universities ',
'The presidents of these universities for a variety of reasons vigorously promoted the welfare of their medical schools ',
'To university leaders research and teaching in medicine carried a special imperative for such work offered the hope of better diagnosis and treatment of disease Ludmerer ',
'Between and these two forces the German trained physicians and ascendance of the university acted to produce a profound change in American medical education at four universities Harvard Pennsylvania Michigan and Johns Hopkins ',
'At Harvard Charles Eliot became president in ',
'He was a chemist who had worked in the laboratory and spent time abroad in Germany ',
'He felt deeply the need to teach science with laboratories ',
'He had a poor view of medical education The ignorance and general incompetency of the average graduate of American Medical Schools at the time he receives the degree which turns him loose upon the community is something horrible to contemplate ',
'His strong views on the need to reform medical education met with resistance and hostility on the part of the older faculty ',
'In November Eliot took the unprecedented step of assuming the chair at a meeting of the medical faculty a seat he did not relinquish for the next forty years ',
'No other event more dramatically symbolized the desire of the modern university to take charge of medical education ',
'With the support of his faculty allies Eliot tried to push through his ideas of reforming the medical school ',
'For a year as the two factions locked horns the faculty was torn with strife ',
'This was no conflict between elite and ordinary physicians but a civil war within the ranks of the elite ',
'A deep chasm divided those with French from those with German views of medical science providing a microcosm of the conflict besetting the elite medical community throughout America ',
'Ludmerer p ',
"Eliot pushed through his ideas successfully and in appointed Henry Bowditch just back from Ludwig's laboratory in Germany as the faculty member in physiology ",
'Bowditch was the first medical professor in America to be full time in teaching and research ',
'The laboratory became the seat for teaching a greatly expanded basic science curriculum ',
"This focus upon the laboratory fostered a new educational philosophy the primary goal of medical education in the eyes of the Harvard faculty was not to provide students an encyclopedic knowledge of facts but to foster the student's ability to think critically to solve problems to acquire new information to keep up with the changing times ",
'This could best be done in the laboratory rather than in the lecture hall Ludmerer p ',
'The University of Pennsylvania medical school underwent similar reforms in followed closely by the University of Michigan ',
'The reforms in these three schools set the stage for the most extraordinary development of all the opening of the Johns Hopkins Medical School in ',
'This new medical school embodied astonishing innovations from its inception strict admission requirements for students two years of rigorous basic science training with plentiful laboratory experience two years of clinical experience at the hospital bedside a faculty chosen solely for their teaching and research ability a view that research was one of its high priorities ',
'The acquisition of William Osler as professor and head of medicine at the Johns Hopkins Medical School was of the highest importance in the development of medical education and the foundation of clinical work as a science in the United States ',
'In this one man there was a confluence of all the forces described earlier in this chapter an appreciation of the importance of the laboratory and research a reverence for the clinical greats who had laid the foundations of physical diagnosisAuenbrugger Laennec Louis a solid foundation in pathology ',
'His training and historical interest had given him the knowledge and perspective to incorporate in one medical educational setting all that the heritage of medicine had slowly and painfully evolved up to that time Harvey ',
'The medical clinic instructional model that Osler put into effect revolutionized medical teaching in the art and science of diagnosis and patient care ',
'There were three aspects to the clinic ',
"There was a live in resident staff with graded experience from the new graduate to more senior residents of several years' experience ",
'Instruction in methods of history taking and physical diagnosis was emphasized to a degree not seen since Louis ',
'Medical students became actual members of the patient care team taking histories doing physicals doing the laboratory work and making rounds with the residents and faculty ',
'Thus evolved the medical clerkship which was extended to surgery obstetrics and gynecology ',
'This clerkship did for the clinical students what laboratory work did for the scientists ',
'From the proprietary schools of the Civil War to the Johns Hopkins Medical School of the teaching of medicine had changed dramatically Ludmerer ',
'Three basic changes had occurred the curriculum was more rigorous many new subjects were added the student became an active participant rather than a passive observer ',
'The biographical vignettes beginning each section of this book take up where this chapter leaves off ',
'These vignettes present individuals who have made seminal contributions to clinical diagnosis in the United States ',
'They are listed in Table ',
'This chapter has traced the stages in the knowledge and forces that have shaped the modern history and physical examination ',
'As stated in the beginning this has been a story of scholarship largely achieved by physicians going about the daily work of delivering patient care ',
'They serve to stimulate us to rise above the routines of the daily ward round ',
'One cannot solve a problem without first determining that it exists ',
'In the earliest stages of the history the clinician elicits the chief complaint and other health concerns ',
"This technique of symptom and problem listing provides the interviewer with diagnostic leads to generate hypotheses and assists in prioritizing the patient's concerns so the problem solver can grasp the big picture and appreciate any potential interrelationship between the various symptoms and problems identified ",
'Another advantage of symptom listing is that it may avoid the dilemma posed by the patient with a positive review of systems ',
'As symptoms are evaluated and analyzed other problems are frequently uncovered ',
'Consider a patient who presents with joint pains ',
'During review of this problem the physician learns that salicylate therapy alleviated the symptoms but was discontinued ',
'Querying the patient discloses that there was an episode of black stools ',
'Thus the additional problem of melena is identified ',
'Obviously there is no correlate of symptom listing in the physical and laboratory areas ',
'However problems are identified in a fashion similar to the patient with melena above ',
'As an example a clinician has interviewed a patient with chest pain and has a strong suspicion that it represents angina pectoris ',
'During routine cardiac examination the patient is found to have a systolic crescendo decrescendo murmur heard best at the second right intercostal space and radiating to the carotid vessels ',
'Heretofore aortic stenosis had not been a problem ',
'As for the laboratory consider a woman who presents with peripheral edema ',
'Neither the history nor the physical examination supports a cardiac hepatic venous or renal cause ',
'Preliminary laboratory investigation includes obtaining a serum albumin level to test the hypothesis of decreased colloid oncotic pressure from liver disease and a urinalysis to confirm or eliminate the possibility of nephrotic syndrome ',
'Both are negative but the urine does contain moderate amounts of glucose ',
"The possibility of diabetes mellitus now enters this patient's medical profile ",
'Formulation and revision of hypotheses are constant features of diagnostic reasoning and pervade the entire encounter Fig ',
'This is somewhat contrary to what is commonly believed since hypothesis generation is usually ascribed to the history ',
'Hypotheses may be general and refer to topographic parts of the anatomy such as domains organ system region channel and foci a subset of domain ',
'When domains are diseased certain symptoms and signs emanate ',
'Hypotheses may be specific as well and refer to certain explicatory sets Table ',
'These sets may be further categorized into disorders congestive heart failure derangements myocardial infarction pathoanatomic entities coronary thrombosis and pathophysiologic entities hyperlipoproteinemia ',
'The more specific the symptom or sign elicited the better chance of activating specific hypotheses ',
'For instance nausea inspiratory rales and an elevated sedimentation rate are nonspecific whereas syncope S gallop and heavy proteinuria are specific ',
'The latter three examples evoke a more narrow differential diagnosis ',
'Some clinical manifestations may even be pathognomonic that is only one hypothesis fits ',
'Consider the significance of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Cheyne Stokes respirations an arterial plaque in the fundus etc ',
'The seasoned practitioner more reliably generates specific hypotheses ',
'Hypothesis generation is predicated on informed intuition ',
'It is imaginative and to a great extent subconscious ',
'Frequently armed with the mere knowledge of age sex and chief complaint the clinician can entertain general and specific hypotheses that implicate common reversible and even exotic disease states ',
'In fact early hypothesis generation is the rule ',
'Nevertheless this is more readily achievable if the case is familiar ',
'Conversely with an unfamiliar case effective hypothesis generation is often delayed until a higher percentage of the complete data base is collected ',
'In this latter situation it is best to concentrate on topographic and not explicatory sets ',
'Typically only a few hypotheses can be entertained at any time ',
'Clinical findings elicited during the medical interview and physical examination generates the most hypotheses but positive laboratory data contribute very little to generation of new hypotheses ',
'Usually laboratory procedures are utilized to confirm or reject hypotheses ',
'The number of hypotheses generated depends on the experience of the clinician ',
"This is the strategy in which the clinician obtains the patient's story and performs the core physical and laboratory examinations in order to clarify and refine hypotheses generated to date ",
'The major elements of hypothesis evaluation are characterization doing and choosing manifestations thinking ',
'Ultimately these contribute in a meaningful way to the reformulation of hypotheses for appropriate analysis later ',
'To this point there has been identification of problems and generation of hypotheses ',
'In order to resolve a problem of unknown cause as is often the case at the bedside the physician is confronted with the decision either to search in a nonbiased manner for information through hypothesis evaluation or proceed directly with hypothesis analysis ',
'The option of evaluation grants the potential to convert an open ended problem into one that is more defined and in the history dramatically increases the probability of eliciting affirmative responses that are of significantly greater value than when directly testing hypotheses ',
'If one resorts to hypothesis analysis immediately there is a certain risk to assume ',
'On the one hand the problem in question may be solved promptly ',
'If the result is negative or not particularly helpful however then premature closure is likely and very little has been accomplished ',
'The following two cases are illustrative A year old man presents with progressive dyspnea ',
'No doubt the topographic hypotheses of cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea come to mind immediately ',
'Perhaps such explicatory set hypotheses as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure are entertained ',
'Hypothesis evaluation dictates that the physician obtain a clearer picture of dyspnea by determining the circumstances and characteristics of dyspnea What ',
'How ',
'When ',
'Where? whereas hypothesis analysis would cause the clinician to query the patient immediately about tobacco usage and a prior history of myocardial infarction etc ',
'In the second case a year old man consults his physician for anorexia weight gain and increased abdominal girth ',
'There is a strong suspicion of heavy alcohol intake ',
'The examining physician may choose to evaluate the patient thoroughly by a careful and methodical examination of all core systems or resort to an hypothesis driven examination where only the supraclavicular fossae are palpated neoplastic nodes the abdomen is inspected for distention ascites palpated for masses hepatosplenomegaly and fluid wave ascites and the skin checked for spider angiomas the breasts examined for gynecomastia and the testicles palpated for atrophy ',
'The latter three represent direct testing for potential complications from alcoholism ',
'The hallmarks of characterization are chronology severity influential factors and expert witness ',
'Chronology is applicable to the interview only and is the crux of any present illness ',
'Just as virtually every pathophysiologic process has a beginning an intermediate stage and current status so does each clinical manifestation of disease ',
'Frequently just determining the chronology of a symptom carries clinical significance for diagnostic purposes ',
'Consider the implications of the year old woman with intermittent disabling headaches for years versus the patient who has suffered similar headaches but only for the last weeks ',
"Severity is an index of the magnitude progression and impact of the disease on the patient's lifestyle ",
'This technique assists the clarification process immeasurably ',
'Reflect on the significance of the following a patient with extertional and nonexertional chest pain who consumes to sublingual trinitroglycerin tablets per day and is unable to work a patient with longstanding peptic ulcer disease who presents with an exacerbation and on physical examination is found to have marked epigastric involuntary guarding and the patient with progressive dyspnea whose pulmonary function testing reveals marked airflow obstruction on all parameters ',
'Precipitating events alleviating elements exacerbating stimuli and associated symptoms or signs form the components of influential factors ',
'These are well known aspects of symptom characterization in the present illness but perhaps not appreciated when performing physical examination maneuvers and laboratory procedures ',
'For instance when examining an elderly woman who injured her hip in a fall palpation and observation reveal that the pain is partially alleviated with hip flexion exacerbated with other movements and that there are associated signs of adductor muscle spasm and external rotation of the hip ',
'As for the laboratory a year old man presents with substernal pressure like chest pain occurring more commonly at rest than after exertion ',
'Both the physical examination and resting electrocardiogram are normal ',
'During a treadmill electrocardiogram mm of ST depression developed in the inferior leads precipitated one episode of six beat atrial tachycardia was observed associated and all changes reverted to baseline minutes after completion of the procedure alleviated ',
'The expert witness technique is a method to validate to collect additional information of diagnostic importance and to assist in the determination of severity ',
'The physician implements this strategy during the interview with the patient when communicating with family friends ambulance technicians nurses etc and during the physical and laboratory examinations by requesting informal and formal second opinion consultations from colleagues ',
'There are distinct advantages in the diagnostic and therapeutic framework when a critical finding is confirmed by a trusted associate ',
'Is there asymmetry of the supraclavicular fossae ',
'Is this nevus suspicious for neoplasm ',
'Do you see an infiltrate in the lingula ',
'Are these atypical lymphocytes ',
'As a result of such exchange clinical certainty is increased and the probability of premature closure is lessened ',
'There is a constant interplay between characterization and choosing manifestations ',
'The latter is an intermediate step of hypothesis evaluation in which symptoms signs and problems are translated into medically meaningful terms with appropriate pathophysiological significance ',
'Two categories exist under choosing manifestations labeling and deviance ',
'Labeling permits the matching of symptoms and signs with accepted medical terminology ',
"Accuracy depends on the clinician's and patient's ability to perceive interact and respond to the other individual's verbal comments ",
"When examining the patient the physician's psychomotor skills perception and interpretation of findings are necessary to label correctly ",
'Frequently when describing or inscribing physical findings they are not expressed literally and only the interpretative statement is made ',
'The term spider angiomas quite adequately and completely accounts for the description there are multiple erythematous dot like lesions with serpiginous processes radiating in several different directions they blanch on pressure and refill centrally when the pressure is released ',
'The exception is the situation when findings cannot be labeled because the clinician is not knowledgeable enough to do so ',
'In a laboratory study the process is the same as in the physical examination despite the fact that labeling may be the province of a consultant ',
'As an example a radiologic procedure would probably be interpreted more expertly by a radiologist ',
'Obviously there are many pitfalls and errors in labeling because the process is complex subjective and dynamic ',
'The technique of deviance applies to understanding the ranges of normalcy and abnormality in assessing the significance of symptoms and signs being evaluated ',
'Discussion of laboratory normal ranges are contained elsewhere in this book ',
'There is considerable difficulty in assigning normalcy and abnormality to clinical manifestations collected during the history and physical ',
"The physician's challenge in the history depends not only on his or her clinical skills zeal and biases but also on the patient's level of cooperation and memory ",
'Thus without attention to details misperceptions and verbal misstatements occur ',
'Likewise signs elicited during the physical examination are at best semiquantitative ',
'The danger of course is either overinterpretation or underinterpretation of manifestations ',
'The consequences of the former are needless worry unnecessary investigations operations treatments and excessive costs ',
'In the opposite situation an underlying disease is not detected ',
'There is rarely difficulty in determining the abnormal state when marked deviations from normal exist ',
'It is when the manifestation is less than severe that the clinician has a dilemma ',
'It is no wonder that items in the history and physical are reviewed and repeated that the same laboratory procedure is reordered and that an advanced level test of a more invasive and costly nature is requested ',
'Furthermore these situations typically result in soliciting second opinions from other experts ',
'Whether it be soliciting a response during the history performing a physical examination maneuver or utilizing a laboratory test the physician proceeds from an open ended data collection mode in characterization to direct and specific ones in hypothesis analysis ',
'Implicit in this definition is either a yes no response in the history or a positive negative result in the physical and laboratory examinations ',
'Although clinical experience and knowledge of pathophysiology are central to any aspect of the patient physician encounter they are infinitely more essential when testing hypotheses ',
'Frequently clinicians may characterize with only topographic based hypotheses in mind but it is impossible to analyze without explanatory sets relating to explicit entities etiologies and complications at hand ',
'The intellectual preparatory mechanisms embodied in analyzing result in questions maneuvers and procedures that reflect more synthesis development and creativity ',
'While employing this strategy the clinician focuses on solidifying or refuting hypotheses entertained ',
'The reward for the yes no response and the positive negative result justifies any inherent risk assumed by thwarting spontaneous symptom related statements from the patient and by sacrificing detailed evaluation of every aspect of the physical and laboratory examinations ',
'The danger of premature closure is no longer a factor ',
'The presence of a symptom problem or physical sign already localized to a domain and focus requires the search for other symptoms and signs that if present may be manifestations of disease in the same domain ',
'This is explorative direct questioning and examining in a nondirective manner ',
'The clinician assumes that pursuing symptoms and signs within the same system is more likely to yield positive results than embarking on a questioning and examining process in an unrelated system area ',
"It also compensates for the physician's fallibility in remembering and recognizing all disease patterns provides additional thinking time and permits one to rule out more remote or even more common possibilities ",
'This strategy depends on that basic fund of knowledge related to etiologies and complications of disease processes ',
"In this context as one applies the principles of the history physical and laboratory medicine to resolve a patient's problems the pervasive and primary concern is to affix causality ",
"This is the essence of the physician's expectations as a problem solver ",
'Inherent in utilizing the technique of pathophysiology is that no question maneuver or procedure can be effected without a specific hypothetical explicatory set in mind Figure Table ',
'Searching for etiological clues assists the clinician in isolating the problem according to the pathoanatomic and pathophysiologic entities whereas seeking complications facilitates focusing on derangements and disorders ',
'Note that the latter two as explicatory sets do explain symptoms and signs but rarely if ever account for ultimate causation ',
'For instance when determining that a patient has paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea the theory is that congestive heart failure is responsible for the symptom ',
'As a disorder however congestive heart failure is a complication of a more basic disease mechanism perhaps myocardial infarction secondary to atherosclerosis which in itself may be caused by acquired hyperlipidemia etc ',
'This particular subsection of hypothesis analysis addresses techniques that transcend purity in diagnostic reasoning ',
'In all preceding sections the goal was strictly the pursuit of a diagnosis ',
'The concept of clinician priority attempts to focus the diagnostic process into the practical perspective of clinical medicine ',
'These techniques are utilized subconsciously throughout the encounter but are rarely appreciated as such by the clinician ',
'They represent the art of medicine and picking up the game strategies that one assimilates perhaps by osmosis during clinical training apprenticeships and through continuing professional experience ',
'There are five such categories urgency uncertainty threshold reversibility and commonness ',
'When a clinician acts out of urgency it is because the presence of a particular symptom or sign implies that immediate diagnostic or therapeutic intervention is indicated ',
'It is action oriented ',
'Attention is directed toward the acutely ill and potentially acutely ill who may have serious life threatening or fatal diseases ',
'Accordingly uncommon entities may be ranked higher than those with greater frequency of occurrence ',
'With this in mind it is easy to comprehend why the physician chooses to elicit the presence of rigors in a patient with fever dysuria and flank pain Is the patient bacteremic ',
'and dedicates more than a few moments to observe the same patient carefully for pilo erection and decreased skin perfusion ',
'There are even occasions in which the search for a particular complication hypovolemia from diarrhea provides a much stronger stimulus for the clinician than the cause of the diarrhea itself ',
'Coping with uncertainty at the bedside is universal ',
'It plagues the physician but protects the patient ',
'Basically this strategy forces one to collect more historical physical examination and laboratory data than may be necessary because the consequences of diagnostic error without doing so are too great ',
'A decision must be made at what level uncertainty is tolerable ',
'The challenge is to be conservative and to avoid errors of omission ',
'It is as if the fear of clinical consequences and its attendant penalties enable clinicians to be more effective ',
'Unfortunately there is excessive reliance on laboratory medicine ',
'It is infinitely more acceptable to implement the strategy of uncertainty to its fullest during history taking and the physical examination when patient risk is virtually nonexistent but it is not necessarily more judicious when utilizing laboratory procedures ',
'Threshold is the converse of uncertainty ',
'It is that point at which further data could be collected but neither a positive nor a negative response would contribute to the analytic process or change the predictive value significantly ',
'Uncertainty prevails until that critical point when the remaining doubt can be tolerated ',
'The dilemma is whether to continue being driven by uncertainty or to invoke threshold ',
'If the threshold is set too high then redundant and often needless information is sought ',
'When set too low the physician may negate an opportunity to make a diagnosis or institute therapy ',
'The emphasis on reversibility or treatability embodies the essence of medicine that is cure the patient ',
'Relevant data must be collected to aid therapeutic decision making ',
'If presented with two competing hypotheses the one with the greatest potential for treatment will be ranked higher ',
'The payoff for doing so is greater ',
'The following case exemplifies this A year old man has had progressively worsening dyspnea for years without associated wheezing ',
'Physical examination reveals findings compatible with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ',
'Pulmonary function spirometry with and without bronchodilators is ordered despite the fact the patient has clinical evidence of irreversible disease ',
'It is hoped that a reactive obstructive component responsive to bronchodilator therapy will be uncovered ',
'The adage common things are common aptly describes the technique of commonness ',
"Of those techniques discussed previously it is most likely to be in the clinician's awareness ",
'The issue is one of good sense ',
'It is not helpful to entertain an uncommon hypothesis unless there is good reason as when invoking urgency and uncertainty ',
'Thus in the patient with abdominal pain in whom pancreatitis is under consideration why collect data about symptoms relevant to renal disease emboli vasculitis etc when it is more appropriate to investigate the presence of symptoms of cholelithiasis and alcohol intake both of which account for of the cases of acute pancreatitis ',
'Similarly in a patient with an enlarging abdomen and swollen ankles it will be a much higher priority to check for signs of cardiac and hepatic diseases as opposed to those implicating inferior vena cava obstruction ',
'This process involves both consolidation of clinical data and refinement and modification of diagnostic possibilities to assist in solidifying hypotheses refuting them and distinguishing between two likely candidates ',
'Elimination enables one to disprove a hypothesis in a convincing manner by seeking negative responses and results to questions and maneuvers of high sensitivity true positive rate for a given hypothesis ',
'Thus it is difficult to entertain seriously the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis without sore throat reactive airway disease without prolonged expiration and nephrotic syndrome in the patient without proteinuria ',
'Discriminating between two closely related hypotheses is a frequent challenge ',
'In the patient with several episodes of hematochezia determining whether the blood is on the outside of the stool or mixed in with the stool helps to distinguish between anal disease and luminal pathology more proximal to the anus ',
'A comparable example in the physical examination is attempting to transilluminate a scrotal mass and in the laboratory arena when ordering a serum gamma glutamyltransferase in a patient with elevated alkaline phosphatase ',
'Finally with confirmation one attempts to clinch a diagnosis by seeking clinical manifestations of high specificity despite the fact that one or more bits of data already support such ',
'Thus discerning that a patient has low back pain that radiates to the thigh and lateral calf is suggestive of radiculopathy ',
'But determining that this pain is associated with numbness and that it is exacerbated by coughing sneezing and straining is even more convincing ',
'Similarly in the physical examination of a patient with dyspnea on exertion the findings of peripheral edema hepatomegaly inspiratory rales and distended neck veins support the contention that left sided heart failure is the cause but the finding of an S gallop is definitive and confirms the suspicion ',
'This element in the sequential strategic process of diagnostic reasoning encompasses the synthesis and integration of multiple clinical clues from the vast amount of data collected ',
'Assembling is governed by the principle that a hierarchical organizational structure of facts exists in the scheme of diagnosis ',
'The stimuli are to reduce the scope of the problem and sort out the complexities encountered to date ',
'Ultimately a working problem list will be developed to guide any further investigative pursuits and therapeutic management ',
'To be functional the problem list must be both coherent and adequate in the context of the patient being evaluated ',
'In history taking hypothesis assembling encompasses the formulation of a narrowed set of hypotheses to permit further characterization and analysis during the physical examination and laboratory testing ',
'At the conclusion of the physical examination all clues and elicited manifestations from the history and physical undergo the same process to direct laboratory data collection ',
'Finally after all appropriate laboratory tests are completed the problem list is transformed into the refined product of impressions and diagnoses ',
'Many positive and negative items elicited at the bedside are not relevant and must be filtered out ',
'Pertinence determines which normal and abnormal manifestations will be retained or disregarded and which will require further attention ',
'In general findings with pathophysiological significance especially those with a high clinician priority will be kept ',
'Likewise symptoms and signs will be retained if there is a potential for inclusion in a particular explicatory set ',
'For example an year old man has a day history of nausea vomiting once daily diarrhea five to ten times daily headache nasal stuffiness and dizziness ',
'He was treated with antibiotics for a carbuncle weeks ago and has a past history of left inguinal herniorrhaphy and cholecystectomy ',
'On physical examination he had a mm Hg orthostatic drop in systolic blood pressure poor skin turgor scarred tympanic membranes anisocoria S gallop right upper quadrant and left inguinal scars active bowel sounds diffuse abdominal tenderness perianal erythema perianal skin tag and a mildly enlarged prostate ',
'Are headache nasal stuffiness left inguinal herniorrhaphy scarred tympanic membranes anisocoria etc pertinent ']
